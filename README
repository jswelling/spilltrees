This package provides spilltrees of arbitrary dimensionality.  They
are very useful data structures for nearest neighbor finding- see
"An Investigation of Practical Approximate Nearest Neighbor Algorithms" 
by Liu, Moore, Gray and Yang for details.  By an appropriate choice
of parameters the spilltree can be converted to a metric tree, which
finds exact nearest neighbors (albeit more slowly).

The standard installation procedure is just to un-tar the file
(which you have presumably already done), cd into the newly
created directory, and then do:

  python setup.py build_ext --force
  sudo python setup.py install

The separate build_ext and install lines are necessary because of
the mechanism which constructs modules of different dimensionalities 
as needed.  See the Distutils guide to installing Python modules at

 http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/inst/inst.html

for additional options, including instructions for installing
the software in a personal directory.

By default, this package builds support for 2-dimensional spilltrees.
To change the dimensionality, edit setup.cfg .  Instructions are
included in the file.  It is also possible to change the configuration
so that floating point numbers are represented as doubles rather than 
by the default 4-byte floats.
